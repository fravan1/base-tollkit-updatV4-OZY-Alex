## ❓ VERY BASIC QUESTIONS

### Q: I'm afraid to break something?
**A:** Impossible! Forking creates a copy. Any error affects only YOUR copy. Seb's original repo is safe.

### Q: What is a "Pull Request"?
**A:** It means "Seb, look what I changed, do you want to add it?". If Seb agrees, your changes are added.

### Q: How long does this take?
**A:** About 30 minutes for 12 contributions + 15 min to create your repo = 45 min MAX.

### Q: Do I have to wait for Seb to accept my PRs before making my repo?
**A:** NO! You can do both at the same time.

### Q: Will others who fork my repo also earn points?
**A:** YES! That's the idea. They earn 12 points on your repo, and you earn on theirs.
